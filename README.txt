<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Application Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://gamers.org.ua)

The original idea for this project was to create an interactive portal for gamers that love to spend their time playing different board games online. Ideally, all the players were supposed to communicate with each other live via conference call, while playing the game. Basically, without a necessity to join any 3rd party communication application, so everything is at a single place.

The first game, created on the portal, was based on the real board game called "Stay away!" - I have been playing it with my friends a lot. After searching for any available online-versions and and not finding any results, I have tried contacting the authors to inform them that I am going to create an online version for the game.

Unfortuantely, I have not received any replies, but nevertheless, I have started working on the game logic. It was quite straightforward, as I had the original board game with the rulebook. It took me around half a year to finalize the first game on the website, and the result was quite a nice one - all my friends were really excited about it, and we kept spending our time playing the game online, whenever we were unable to do this IRLðŸ˜€
