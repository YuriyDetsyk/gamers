PC:


MOBILE:
- incorrect tooltip positioning on card hover
- incorrect menu positioning on card click
- both hover and click on touch (hard to use)
- tooltip not hiding after taking a deck card

GENERAL:
- need to add 5 last steps for debugging purposes

TEST:
- card hover tooltip overflows page limits [NOT SURE]
- BUG: after player swapping, videos will become duplicated for both players, but not others [ADDED FIX, NEEDS VERIFICATION]
- player can have too many cards [?]
- fix 'It' border
- video drops sometimes
- add ability to stop / restart the game without leaving
- reassign room owner on leave
- Error: Missing active event card
    at CardService.giveHandCard (card.service.ts:1791)
    at BotService.processBotStep (bot.service.ts:230)
    // If card accepts regular workflow - back to the requester with regular swap
    const activeEventCard = this.gameService.getActiveEventCard();
    if (isNil(activeEventCard)) {
        throw new Error('Missing active event card');
    }

BUGS:
- when playing counter-clockwise, locked door is placed to the wrong side / player (UI)
- Nechto border image is not visible (UI)
- recommended (add ability to accept / defence with submit, currently only defence and auto-accept)
- player could not return the card back when answering to card exchange by 'Soblazn'
- after the bug, other players can also play on themselves
- after playing 'Persistence', panic card was added to the table

REFACTORING:
- optimize canPlay, canGive, canDrop, canTake & receivingPlayers
